abstract = {Stock also known as equity or shares is a type of security that signifies ownership in a corporation and represents a claim on part of the corporations assets and earnings whereas a stock market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks. Stock Exchange is defined as a process where the stock brokers can buy as well as sell the shares, bonds or other securities. Many companies regardless of their domains or sectors make their stocks or shares available through Stock Market. Such type of an exchange deals with concentration and a focused mind as the entire process is dealing with valuable assets of a person. Thus to ease the process of stock exchange many stock brokers use the act of predicting the stock prices i.e. trying to determine the whether the financial instruments of a company will go up or down in their values. Prediction is done by fundamental analysis and technical analysis and now using Machine Learning Concepts. In this project we propose a Convolutional Neural Network for predicting the stock price in order to make profit.},

@inproceedings{Vorakitphan2019,
abstract = {In recent years, social networking platform serves as a new media of news sharing and information diffusion. Social networking platform has become a part of our daily life. As such, social media advertising budgets have explosively expanded worldwide over the past few years. Due to the huge commercial interest, clickbait behaviors are commonly observed, which use attractive headlines and sensationalized textual description to bait users to visit websites. Clickbaits mainly exploit the users' curiosity's gap by interesting headlines to entice its readers to click an accompanying link to articles often with poor contents. Clickbaits are bothersome either to social media users or platform site owners. In this paper, we propose an approach called Ontology-based LSTM Model (OLSTM) to detect clickbaits. Compared with the existing solutions for clickbait detection, our approach is characterized by the following three components: word embedding model, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and word ontology information. The observation is that preserving semantic relationships is significantly an important factor to be considered in detecting clickbaits. Therefore, we propose to capture semantic relationships between words by word embedding models. In addition, we adopted RNN as our classification models to consider word orders in a sentence. Furthermore, we consider the word ontology relation as another feature set for clickbait classification, as clickbaits often uses words with generalized concepts to induce curiosity. We conduct experiments with real data from Twitter and news websites to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which demonstrates that the employment of the proposed method improves clickbait detection accuracy from 80{\%} to 90{\%} compared with the existing solutions.},

@article{Kaur2020,
abstract = {Clickbait indicates the type of content with an intending goal to attract the attention of readers. It has grown to become a nuisance to social media users. The purpose of clickbait is to bring an appealing link in front of users. Clickbaits seen in the form of headlines influence people to get attracted and curious to read the inside content. The content seen in the form of text on clickbait posts is very short to identify its features as clickbait. In this paper, a novel approach (two-phase hybrid CNN-LSTM Biterm model) has been proposed for modeling short topic content. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model when implemented with pre-trained GloVe embedding yields the best results based on accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score performance metrics. The proposed model achieves 91.24{\%}, 95.64{\%}, 95.87{\%} precision values for Dataset 1, Dataset 2 and Dataset 3, respectively. Eight types of clickbait such as Reasoning, Number, Reaction, Revealing, Shocking/Unbelievable, Hypothesis/Guess, Questionable, Forward referencing are classified in this work using the Biterm Topic Model (BTM). It has been shown that the clickbaits such as Shocking/Unbelievable, Hypothesis/Guess and Reaction are the highest in numbers among rest of the clickbait headlines published online. Also, a ground dataset of non-textual (image-based) data using multiple social media platforms has been created in this paper. The textual information has been retrieved from the images with the help of OCR tool. A comparative study is performed to show the effectiveness of our proposed model which helps to identify the various categories of clickbait headlines that are spread on social media platforms.},

abstract = {Online content publishers often use catchy headlines for their articles in order to attract users to their websites. These headlines, popularly known as clickbaits, exploit a user's curiosity gap and lure them to click on links that often disappoint them. Existing methods for automatically detecting clickbaits rely on heavy feature engineering and domain knowledge. Here, we introduce a neural network architecture based on Recurrent Neural Networks for detecting clickbaits. Our model relies on distributed word representations learned from a large unannotated corpora, and character embeddings learned via Convolutional Neural Networks. Experimental results on a dataset of news headlines show that our model outperforms existing techniques for clickbait detection with an accuracy of 0.98 with F1-score of 0.98 and ROC-AUC of 0.99.},
